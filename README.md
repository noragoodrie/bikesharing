# BIKESHARING

**OVERVIEW**

Bikes, bikes and more bikes! This project was made in order to show proper visualization to bring in the potential investors for the NYC Citibike sharing program. These visuals will help show investors how brilliant this business is. We were able to prepare handfulls of different charts, graphs and maps to display our data properly in a very eye catching way.


**TOP STARTING LOCATIONS**

This map was created by taking the start station longitude and latitude as well as the total count of the CSV. Displayed we can see that the bigger and darker the markers aka the circles that is were the most stations had a higher starting point for rides.


**TOP ENDING LOCATIONS**

Similar to the top starying locations you can see that this map is built the same way. The bigger and darker the circles the more locations were dropped off at! We suspect that this is a top tourist area as well as a great place for commuter travel! 


**CHECKOUT TIMES PER USAGE**

<img width="860" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-09 at 5 38 50 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91299616/148709741-a4c73334-0239-43d3-9243-5cb707687b69.png">

The checkout times per usage was created by tripduration-HOUR, tripduartion-MINUTE, total CSV count and it created this line chart for us. You can see that 145,147 bikes were checked out for a duration of 6 minutes. 6 MINUTES isn't that wild?

**CHECOUT TIMES BY GENDER

<img width="858" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-09 at 5 41 02 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91299616/148709823-134cd95c-4f68-465a-9bba-d81766b03182.png">

This line chart is exactly like the one above but we also incorperated gender into it! 

- Female = BLUE
- Male = ORANGE
- Unknown = RED

We can see that men rent the bikes out for less amount of time, compared to women.

**TRIPS PER WEEKDAY PER HOUR**

<img width="856" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-09 at 5 44 15 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91299616/148709958-bd835938-77d7-4450-9aa8-c24346c2d644.png">

The heatmap created was created by stoptime - WEEKDAY, starttime -HOUR and total count. We can see from this heatmap that Thursdays at 6pm is when the most bikes are checkedout!

**TRIPS PER WEEKDAY BY GENDER**

<img width="961" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-09 at 5 47 12 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91299616/148710068-20244c0e-1c62-49b7-89cd-2736f79208fd.png">

This heatmap is exactly like the previous one except that it is broken down by gender. 

Top Female Checkout - Thursdays at 6pm
Top Male Checkout - Thursdays at 6pm
To Unknown Checkout - Saturdays at 12pm

**USER RIDES BY GENDER BY WEEKDAY**

<img width="899" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-09 at 5 49 50 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91299616/148710179-7d7f4a71-4f0a-4012-aa76-d419a58330a1.png">

This map is broken down by usertype aka Subscriber or Customer. We can see that male subscribers throughout the week are the top users of Citibikes.

**SUMMARY**

We found that men are the top users of CitiBike throughout the week, but females also use it quite a bit! Subscribers are the top users of this service, compared to customers! A suggestion for an additional visual is to make a map of how Start location to End location to see the path that the customers take, weither its 1 mile to 9 miles. Another visual we can add to is how many people use this as their transpertation to work or shopping, or everyday activites compared to those who use it one time because they are in the area!
