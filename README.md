**OVERVIEW**

Bikes, bikes and more bikes! This project was made in order to show proper visualization to bring in the potential investors for the NYC Citibike sharing program. These visuals will help show investors how brilliant this business is. We were able to prepare handfulls of different charts, graphs and maps to display our data properly in a very eye catching way.
